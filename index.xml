Before joining Cisco, I spent several years as a network engineer supporting production environments and managing a training and test lab. This role afforded me the invaluable opportunity to lead a quarterly two-week course on Professional-level Route/Switch/UC topics.
Over the past nine years at Cisco, my role has spanned multiple networks and regions, where I&amp;rsquo;ve been responsible for the complete lifecycle of customer engagementsâ€”from demonstrating the potential of Cisco software management to securing follow-on orders.</description></item></channel></rss>

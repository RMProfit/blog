Hello there!

Before joining Cisco, I spent several years as a network engineer supporting production environments and managing a training and test lab. This role afforded me the invaluable opportunity to lead a quarterly two-week course on Professional-level Route/Switch/UC topics.

Over the past nine years at Cisco, my role has spanned multiple networks and regions, where I've been responsible for the complete lifecycle of customer engagementsâ€”from demonstrating the potential of Cisco software management to securing follow-on orders. I've tested intricate configurations in a controlled lab setting and translated these solutions seamlessly to production environments.

My practical experience extends across deploying, troubleshooting, and refining applications such as Call Manager, Instant Messaging, Voicemail, Contact Center, Emergency Responder, Expressways, and Cisco Meeting Server. I have also explored Webex Control Hub and Webex Contact Center through dCloud walkthroughs.

This site is a place to document some of the features I have implemented as well as any other corner case scenarios I come across.

I hope you find this useful....enjoy!
